Exploration of a simple rules based system to markup up items.

Will allow a data driven "rule" to add or modify to data items.

The primary concern for this engine is that it be configurable on the fly without the need
to compile a set of rules.  Traditional rules engine require that rules be compiled into some type
of run-time artifact.  The overhead for these artifacts is high when the number of rule configurations is very high.
This approach is designed to address thousand of unique rules configurations.  Each configuration consumes little
resources.

The engine must have a Big O of no more than n. To meet the goal a few limitations have been imposed on the project.


Limitations:
1. Input data can be a list of items and global data.
2. A rule can only access data from one item at a time.  The rules can also access the global data. Rules cannot iterate.
3. An engine takes a list of rules and the input data.  The input data can consist of items and global data.
4. All iteration is handle by the engine.
